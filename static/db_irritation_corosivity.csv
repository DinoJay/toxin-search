";;;;;;;;;;;;due to the skin colouration by 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene after a 4-hour exposure, it was not possible to definitely conclude on the irritant potential. based on the results obtained with the 1-hour exposure, 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene at 3% in water was slightly irritant for the rabbit skin. ;;;;;3;test substance in water;98.1;;;;506382;test substance: 1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene ;in vivo;rabbit/new zealand white ;;;;m;;;;3;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;0.5 ;ml;;single;dermal;;semi-occlusive, test substance  placed on a dry gauze pad, the gauze pad was held in contact with the skin by means of an adhesive hypoallergenic aerated semiocclusive dressing and a restraining bandage. ;clipped skin on the flank, clipping repeated on several days up to day 9;;3 m, 1 h & 4 h in one rabbit. 1 h & 4 h in the other two rabbits;9;;;;;;;;;;2004;yes;;3;;the untreated skin served as control.;;
