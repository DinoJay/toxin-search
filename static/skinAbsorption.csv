Likewise, for the leave-on formulation, the percentage absorbed was independent of the concentration (78 ± 7% and 81 ± 10% for the 1% and 0.2% concentrations, respectively).;for the rinse-off formulation: 37 and 34 for 1% and 0.2% respectively. and for the leave on formulation: 78 and 81 for the 1% and 0.2% respectively. ;;;;;;;0.2, 1;cleaning gel formulation and body lotion formulations each containing either 0.2 or 1% 2-phenoxyethanol;99.45, chemical purity: >97.5;3381-238;test item: 2-Phenoxyethanol [ethanol-1,2-14C] from new england nuclear, boston, USA;;;human;from abdomen during plastic surgery, frozen stored tissue;;10 (5/2);franzTM static diffusion chambers;PBS ;;;;10 cells per formulation and 2-phenoxyethanol concentration, cells covered with a semi-occlusive filter(MICROPORETM, Scotch 3M), receptor fluid pH: 7.4, cell's surface area 1.76cm2, skin integrity verified beforehand by measuring the trans-epidermal water loss,  because of the fragility of the skin (skin biopsies were kept frozen before their use), the stratum corneum was not removed from the epidermis by tape stripping. the epidermis with stratum corneum was separated from the dermis using forceps. ;;32;;;4.60 and 5.33;sampling at 3,6,9,12 and 24;;;30mins for the cleaning gel, 24 hours for the body lotion;;2002;no;for MoS calculations, mean values + 1 SD may be used: 37% + 10%, i.e. 47% dermal absorption for 1% 2 phenoxyethanol in rinse-off formulations and 78% + 7%, i.e., 85% for 1% 2-phenoxyethanol in leave-on formulations. use of this data for the calculation of a systemic exposure dose (SED) is not necessary since calculation of the margin of safety is based on a dermal toxicity study.;7;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

The data obtained in the different percutaneous absorption studies vary in the range of approximately 10 to 70 μg/cm2.

In many cells investigated, radioactivity in receptor fluid was below the LoQ of 0.029 µg eq/cm2. with respect to healthy skin, only 2 from 8 cells were within the acceptance criteria based on recovery. thus, no conclusion can be drawn on healthy skin. Absorption in (1) irradiated, (2) stripped and (3) irradiated and stripped skin (mean ± 2 SD) was 0.18, 2.34 and 1.37 % of the
applied dose, respectively. as irradiation did not change TEWL, the value obtained from irradiated skin might also be taken for healthy skin.

found in perfusate the percutaneous penetration rate in rat and human skin was very low or below reliably quantifiable concentrations. considering the solubility of fat 65080 in the perfusate (0.16 µg/mL), the flow rate of the perfusate (about 3 mL/h), and the exposed skin membrane area (0.64 cm²) the limit for penetration rate due to the solubility of the test item in the perfusate was estimated to be 0.750 µg/cm²/h. this indicated that the perfusate solubility would not be expected to limit the movement of test item through the skin. there is no information with regard to whether the penetrated substance is present in the form of particles or as solubilised material. the estimated flux for rat skin was 0.044 μg/cm²/h, defined as the penetration rate at steady state between 1-6 hours and calculated by using the corresponding LQ values instead of the measured values, most of which were below LQ. similarly, the flux for human skin was estimated to be 0.042 µg/cm²/h for 1-6 hours based on the LQ values. mean values for absorbed test item of 1.38% and 0.06% of the applied dose were obtained for rat and human skin, respectively. the very low absorption and percutaneous penetration of the test item allowed only an estimation of a flux parameter because the majority of the values were below limits of quantification for the samples. the rat skin was somewhat more permeable to the test item and showed larger amounts of test item in the tape strips and the remaining skin compared to human skin, whereas from human skin almost 95% of the applied dose could be removed with surface wipe and membrane rinses. both test systems showed recovery of more than 98% of applied dose and the test item was shown to remain stable during the 24-hour exposure period.

In stratum corneum 15.38% of the dose was found and 0.18% of the dose was found in the remaining skin membrane after tape stripping, which was significantly lower than observed in rat skin membranes. the mean flux value was calculated to be 0.178 μg/cm²/h. the amount of test item in lower skin layers was significantly lower in human skin membranes as compared to rat skin membranes. therefore the total absorption, based on the amount penetrated through the skin membrane (perfusate) and the amount measured in the remaining skin membrane layers after tape stripping, was 5.07% and 0.28% of the applied dose, or 96.9 μg-eq/cm² and 5.4 μg-eq/cm² for rat and human skin membranes, respectively. based on the flux values a human/rat ration of 1:1.2 was calculated for dermal penetration. recovery: 95.48 ± 1.49 (rat skin) 91.83 ± 5.38 (human skin) ;ret: 0.12%, human: 0.10%;;in conclusion, micronized fat 65080, applied to rat and human skin membranes, penetrated at an extremely low rate and to a very limited extent through the skin membranes. the penetration through rat split-thickness skin membranes was slightly higher than through human split-thickness skin membranes. although, the test item entered the skin membrane after exposure, it did not penetrate through the membrane to a significant extent. the penetration into lower skin layers (below stratum corneum) was more pronounced in rat skin membrane. ;;;;;a concentration of 94 mg/cm³ leading to an area concentration of 1912 μg/cm² (reflecting a concentration of 10 % test item in the final formulation). ;;non-radiolabelled: 98%, radiolabelled: >99%;non-radiolabelled: koc00050/004e,  radiolabelled: 49336-1-61;non-radiolabelled fat65’080 + [14C]-labelled fat 65’080, specific activity 2.11 µCi/mg, micronized with surfactant (plantacare®2000 UP), thickener (xanthan gum) and emulsifier (propylene glycol) to mixture of 90.88 mg [14C labelled fat 65’080/ml, particle size: d(0.5) = 440 nm ;;200 µm;human cadaver, rat skin ;full thickness skin from rats and from humans, removed from subcutaneous fat and upper 200 µm from stratum corneal by dermatome. pieces of 1.8 x 1.8 cm were mounted. ;;7 replicates for each species;flow-through diffusion cells;6% (w/v) polyethoxyoleate (peg 20 oleyl ether) in physiological saline (0.9% NaCl w/v); 0.16 g fat 65’080/ml;;;;;;;0.64 cm2;2 mg/cm2;in hourly intervals between 0-6 hours and thereafter in 2 hours intervals until the end of the experiments;the remaining [14C] fat 65080 was removed from the skin membranes by rinsing the skin membranes three times with a mild soap solution;the skin membranes were removed from the diffusion cell and consecutively stripped until the stratum corneum was removed from the skin membrane.;24h;;;yes;fat 65080 was micronized: the mean particle size of the test item was found to be d(0.5) = 440 nm. given the large variation in the data, the dermal in vitro absorption value for the rat is set as the mean absorption + 2SDs. the mean absorption is calculated by adding the concentration in the perfusate plus the concentration in the remaining skin membrane. this results in an dermal absorption for the rat of 0.12+ 4.85 + 2x√( 0.032 + 3.92) = 12.77%.
