Reproductive data evaluation showed that neither the mating nor the fertility parameters were adversely affected by the test item treatment or administration of the placebo. however, in the placebo control females, a slightly low mean number of corpora lutea, and slightly low mean number of implantations, pups delivered and live pups on day 1 postpartum were obtained. the results for all groups are summarized in the table. the observation of the pups after birth did not reveal any increased incidence of pups dying, adverse effects on the pup body weight gains or influence on the pups’ sex ratio; furthermore, gross malformations were not found in any of the pups. at the post-mortem examinations of the f0 generation parent animals, test item treatmentrelated macroscopic observations were not revealed. none of the differences in organ weights noted between the placebo and control groups or between the test item-treated and the placebo groups were considered to be of toxicological importance. qualitative staging for testis did not indicate any abnormalities in the integrity of the various cell types present within the different stages of the spermatogenic cycle. the oestrous stages were not affected by test item or placebo treatments, and microscopic abnormalities were not revealed in the evaluation of the ovarian follicles and corpora lutea or in the evaluation of the uterus. overall, nanosized eth50 did not show adverse effects to the systemic toxicity endpoints, mating and reproduction parameters, offspring survival to 5 days of age, or to grossly and microscopically evaluated organs and tissues." .

OPP affected kidneys, urinary bladder, liver and spleen. the main effect in the spleen was atrophy (mainly of very slight grade), which was observed in each of the exposed groups. in the liver, although only OPP-treated groups had tumours (type not stated), the tumour incidences did not represent a dose response: the respective incidences at 0, 0.65, 1.3 and 2.6 % OPP were 0%, 5%, 10%, and 5%. in urinary bladder, increases (p<0.05) in the absolute weight occurred at 198 mg/kg bw/d (37 %) and the relative weights at 198 mg/kg bw/d (70 %) and 447 mg/kg bw/d (59 %). OPP induced nonneoplastic lesions in the kidneys (p<0.05 when all severity grades are combined) at the low, mid, and high doses. in addition to the increased incidence, the lesion severity (e.g., tubular epithelium degeneration) also appeared to increase with dose. reduced (p<0.05) absolute kidney weights occurred in each of the OPP-treated groups (7-24 %), but the dose-response seemed consistent with the general body weight reductions noted in these groups (12-43 %)." .

increase in the mean relative and absolute reticulocyte counts and in the mean reticulocyte maturity index in the males and females from the high dose group and the females from the medium dose group; moderate increase in the leukocyte count and in the mean relative and absolute values of neutrophils in the high dose group; at this high dose group effects on lymphocytes and monocyte count were observed. these effects were considered test item related and were reversible at the end of the recovery period. non dose related platelet effects were also observed in the males from the medium and high dose group. clinical biochemistry changes were observed in males and females from the high dose group only at the end of the treatment. these effects may reflect metabolic changes. effects on the electrolyte parameters Na+, Cl- (males and females) were observed and related to the nature of the test item itself (sodium salt) and most of these effects regressed during recovery. some minor changes in parameters of urinalysis were observed in males and females rats from the high dose group and urine discoloration in males rats from the medium dose group. increase in urine turbidity was also observed in male rats from the high dose group. all these effects were reversible after the recovery period. increase in liver, kidney and spleen weights and in their ratios to body and brain weights were observed at the end of treatment in rats from the high dose group. these effects were considered related to the treatment. they were reversible after the recovery period. decreases in mean testes weights, testes to body and brain weights ratios were observed in male rats from the high dose group at the end of treatment. these effects were not reversible after the recovery period. decreases in mean epididymidis weights, epididymidis to body and brain weights ratios were observed in male rats from the high dose group at the end of the recovery period but not during the treatment. macroscopic and microscopic examination after terminal necropsy showed lesions in the testes and epididymides of male rats from the high dose group: size reduction of testes (in nine rats) and epididymides (in six rats) and concerning epididymides thickening (in one rat), nodules (in one rat), foci (in two rats) or cysts (in two rats). severe tubular degeneration, sperm granuloma, azoospermia or oligospermia were reported on the testis of nine rats from the high dose group; these lesions were also observed after the recovery period. as prostate and seminal vesicles were not affected, the authors considered that a testosterone effect is unlikely and the lesions recorded are considered to be of primary cytotoxic nature to sperm. macroscopic lesions (foci or thickening) were also observed on stomach, caecum or mesenteric lymph nodes of some male or female rats. icroscopic findings on gastrointestinal tracts as ulceration or inflammation, fibrosis were reported on some male or female rats from the medium or high dose groups, some of them were always observed after the recovery period. microscopic findings were reported in the spleen and bone marrow in rats from the high dose group of both sexes (extramedullary and medullary hemopoiesis), in the liver in male or female rats from the medium or high dose groups (hepatocellular hypertrophy, in the kidneys in male or female rats from the medium or high dose groups (tubular cell swelling) and in the adrenals in male rats from the high dose group (cortical vacuolation). these findings were not longer present after the recovery period. extramedullary and medullary hemopoiesis were considered by the authors of minor severity degrees and secondary to intestinal perforation, inflammation and haemorrhage. hepatocellular hypertrophy was considered to be of adaptative metabolic nature. increased cortical vacuolation in adrenals was considered related to stress hormone production (fatty change) and the nature of the renal lesions was considered unclear." .

creatinine: +16% and +22%, at 100 and 400 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). as these were not associated with any relevant microscopic findings, they were considered to be of minor toxicological significance. changes in blood glucose levels were also noted in the upper two dose groups (males: -8% and –11%; females: -10% and –9%, at 100 and 400 mg/kg bw/day, respectively). all individual values were close to or within the historical control range and the change was not considered to be of toxicological importance. some other haematological and biochemical parameters showed individual minor statistical differences, but these were not dose-related and were within the historical control range. there were no treatment-related changes in urinalysis. the absolute kidney weight was lower (87% of control) for males treated with 100 mg/kg bw/day, but not at the higher dose and it was therefore not considered to be relevant. there were no other significant differences in the organ weights. microscopic examination revealed minimal to slight brownish pigment accumulation in many organs and tissues (kidneys, alimentary tract, liver and /or mesenteric lymph nodes in animals given 100 or 400 mg/kg bw/day. tubular basophilia was noted in some animals of all male dose groups, including controls, but was more severe in males given 400 mg/kg bw/day. minimal to moderate subacute to chronic aspiration pneumonia was reported in 1/10 females at 25 mg/kg bw/day, 5/10 males and 6/10 females at 100 mg/kg bw/day and 5/10 males and 5/10 females at 400 mg/kg bw/day. brownish pigment-laden macrophages were present within the lesion for the animals of the two upper dose groups, but not for the female treated at 25 mg/kg bw/day. no other relevant changes were reported. remark: the aspiration pneumonia seen in one female rat at 25 mg/kg bw/day was disregarded as non-significant by the study authors, because of the absence of pigmentation. however, on the basis of the information provided, it is not appropriate to discount the possibility that the observation was treatment-related. this would lead to the conclusion that 25 mg/kg bw/day is a LOEL, rather than a NOEL. tubular basophilia is normally associated with regeneration following kidney damage. since it was also seen in controls in this study, the significance is unclear but may be related to exacerbation of a pre-existing condition." .

a statistically significant decreased grip strength of both forelimb and hind limb in group 4 was attributed to the reduced body weight of the animals. haematology results showed a significant (p<0.05) increase in methaemoglobin levels in males and females of the high dose group. a dose-related decrease of the number of white blood cells (p<0.01) was noted in high dose males along with a significantly (p<0.01)reduced absolute number of lymphocytes; these changes were considered dose-related. clinical biochemistry parameters showed a significant (p<0.01) increase of gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in rats of the high dose group (212 % and 202 % in males and females, respectively). the high dose group animals also showed significant (p<0.01) decreases in creatinine levels, in amount of total protein accompanied by disproteinemia, and in urea and uric acid levels. glucose, total bilirubin and phospholipids levels were decreased in high dose males; total cholesterol, creatine kinase and alkaline phosphatase were increased in high dose females. no abnormalities were revealed by urinalysis results. decreased (p<0.05) absolute organ weights and/or organ weight ratios of most organs were recorded for males in the mid and high dose groups and for females in the high dose group. macroscopically, there was a reddish discoloration of the forestomach mucosa, the thymus was reduced in size (high dose), and the thyroid gland was discoloured red-brown (mid dose) or black (high dose). the microscopic findings occurred mainly in the high dose group and included the following: minimal to slight diffuse hepatocellular hypertrophy associated with moderately increased incidence of focal necrosis, and decreased haematopoiesis. the spleen showed a decreased incidence of increased haematopoiesis. in the kidneys an increased incidence of intratubular granular casts and transitional cell hyperplasia occurred in females. non-glandular stomach dilation was observed in one male and one female in the high dose group and most of the high dose animals showed congestion; a low incidence of glandular stomach erosion also occurred. in the thymus, the observed cortical atrophy was considered as a condition of stress rather than an immunotoxic effect. the ovaries showed an interstitial cell hyperplasia considered as a non-neoplastic proliferation of cellular components of the interstitial gland. an increased diffuse fatty change was observed in the adrenal cortices of males and females of the high dose group. thyroid of mid- and high-dose males and females showed an increased incidence of follicular cell hypertrophy, pigmented colloid, and pigmented follicular cells. the pituitary gland of males of these two groups showed an increased incidence of TSH/ACTH cell hypertrophy." .

the higher absolute neutrophil count may have represented an inflammatory response. effects on clinical chemistry test results were limited to higher bilirubin for females given 20 mg/kg bw/day (200% of the value in the control group), which, according to the study report authors could be associated with haemolysis, which would correlate with the haematology findings and pigment-laden macrophages observed in the liver. mean absolute and relative spleen weights were greater than control values in females given 20 mg/kg bw/day (125 and 129% of the control values, respectively). these weight differences were considered test article-related by the study report authors and correlated with an increased incidence of increased extramedullary haematopoiesis noted microscopically in this group. no statistically significant or test article-related organ weight changes were noted in animals at the recovery phase necropsy. all macroscopic findings were considered spontaneous, incidental, and/or unrelated to the test article by the study report authors.test article-related microscopic findings were noted in the liver and spleen of males and females at the dosing phase necropsy. test article-related findings in the liver includedminimal infiltrates of pigment-laden macrophages/kupffer cells in females given 20 mg/kg bw/day, and minimally increased prussian blue staining in males and females given 20 mg/kg bw/day. in the spleen, test article-related findings included minimal infiltrates of pigment-laden macrophages in males given 20 mg/kg bw/day, minimally increased extramedullary haematopoiesis in males and females given 20 mg/kg bw/day, and minimally increased prussian blue staining in males given 20 mg/kg bw/day and femalesgiven 8 or 20 mg/kg bw/day. prussian blue stain detects ferric ions in loosely bound protein complexes, as in hemosiderin. because increased prussian blue staining occurred concurrently with the presence of pigment-laden macrophages and/or kupffer cells in the liver and spleen, the pigment likely represented hemosiderin, according to the study report authors, and suggested red blood cell damage and/or haemolysis as a possible aetiology. this was further supported by the minimal to mild reduction in red blood cell mass in males given 20 mg/kg/day and females given 8 and 20 mg/kg bw/day. because evidence for effects on red blood cells persisted in the recovery phase females, the test article-related morphological changes were considered toxicologically relevant by the study report authors. no differences were observed in the 2.5 and the 5.0 mg/kg bw/day dose groups." .

        ont:observations  "mortality and morbidity of treated animals were checked twice daily, clinical observations were made once per day. once before the first exposure, once a week thereafter and once on week 12, a modified irwin test was performed, which included a functional observation battery (evaluation of reaction of auditory, visual and proprioceptive stimuli and assessment of grip strength and motor activity). ophthalmoscopy was performed before treatment and in the control and 55 mg/kg bw dose groups on week 12. haematological examinations and clinical biochemical analyses were conducted before the first treatment and one day after the last treatment. urinalysis was performed in week 11. animals were killed by pentobarbital and subjected to necroscopy including gross pathological examination, organ-weight determination and histopathology. no clinical signs have been recorded which were considered to be related to a toxic effect of the test substance. no difference was found between the experimental groups with respect to performance in the functional observational test battery before starting the study, one week thereafter and at termination of the study. effects on body weight gain were observed, but these effects were not dose-related. mean daily food consumption was comparable between the control and dosed groups. ophthalmoscopy did not show any test item related alterations. haematology showed some variations in rc, pt, wbc, se, ly and rbc, but these effects were not dose-related. in the 55 mg/kg bw/day dose group, a test item-related and statistically and biologically significant increase in activity of ast and alt was found in male and especially in female animals. histopathology did not reveal dose-related lesions of the examined organs." .
